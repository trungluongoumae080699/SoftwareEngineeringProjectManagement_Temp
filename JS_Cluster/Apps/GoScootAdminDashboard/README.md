GoScoot Map - Animated Scooter Visualization
An interactive map application built with React, TypeScript, and Mapbox GL JS that displays animated scooters moving around Ho Chi Minh City with realistic routing and collision avoidance.

🚀 Features
Interactive Mapbox Map: Full-featured map with zoom, pan, and navigation controls
50 Animated Scooters: Realistic scooter traffic simulation across HCM City
Smart Routing: Scooters follow actual roads using Mapbox Directions API
Collision Avoidance: Intelligent system prevents scooters from overlapping
Smooth Animation: 60 FPS animation using requestAnimationFrame
Responsive Design: Works on desktop and tablet devices
📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher) - Download here
npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
Mapbox Access Token - Get one free here
🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd GoScootJSCluster/JS_Cluster/Apps/goscoot-map
2. Install Dependencies
npm install
Or if you prefer yarn:

yarn install
3. Configure Mapbox Token
Create a .env file in the project root:

# Create .env file
touch .env
Add your Mapbox access token to the .env file:

VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
Important: Replace your_mapbox_token_here with your actual Mapbox access token.

How to Get a Mapbox Token:
Go to Mapbox Account
Sign up or log in
Navigate to "Access Tokens"
Create a new token or copy your default public token
Paste it in your .env file
🚀 Running the Application
Development Mode
Start the development server with hot reload:

npm run dev
The application will open at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is busy).

Production Build
Build the application for production:

npm run build
⚙️ Configuration
You can customize the scooter animation by editing src/scooterAnimation.ts:

// Configuration
const NUM_SCOOTERS = 50;           // Number of scooters (1-100)
const SCOOTER_SPEED = 0.00001;     // Movement speed
const COLLISION_DISTANCE = 0.002;  // Minimum distance between scooters
Adjusting Scooter Count:
Low (10-20): Better performance, less traffic
Medium (30-50): Balanced performance and realism ✅ Recommended
High (60-100): More realistic but may impact performance
🐛 Troubleshooting
Map Not Loading
Problem: Blank screen or error message

Solutions:

Check that your .env file exists and contains a valid Mapbox token
Verify the token format: VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.xxxxx
Restart the development server after adding the token
Scooters Not Appearing
Problem: Map loads but no scooters visible

Solutions:

Check browser console for errors
Ensure scooter_type.png exists in the public folder
Verify your internet connection (needed for Mapbox Directions API)
Performance Issues
Problem: Laggy animation or slow map

Solutions:

Reduce NUM_SCOOTERS in scooterAnimation.ts
Close other browser tabs
Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)
Check your internet speed
Port Already in Use
Problem: Error: Port 5173 is already in use

Solution:

# Kill the process using the port (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <process_id> /F

# Or just use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
